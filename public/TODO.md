1. Different style of sorting (bars, numbers, ...)
2. Option to change max/min values, number of values in array
3. Going to need some next level css to change the size of the container based on numbers of elements and height based on max height


Right Now:
1. SortingAlgos line 79
2. Create shallow copy of array to do sorting (also in SortingAlgos)
3. Standardize test function to generalize to all sorting functions
4. Add animations
